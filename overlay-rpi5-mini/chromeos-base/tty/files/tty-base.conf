# The console doesn't need any of the services provided by boot-services,
# so it is safe to start it in parallel. We don't want the serial console
# to wait for boot-services to start because if boot-services fails, we
# want a serial console to debug the failure. We also don't want to use
# failsafe because that requires boot-services to have started.
