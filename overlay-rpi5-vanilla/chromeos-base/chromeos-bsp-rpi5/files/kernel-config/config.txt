# Display mode
# Defaulting to "kms" mode for better graphics performance, it
# requires an optional flag "fydeos-force-cursor-compositing"
# in /etc/chrome_dev.conf.
# Should you run into display issues, such as black-screen or
# GUI graphics not being able to render properly, you can
# toggle the display mode to "fkms" to enable a compatibility
# mode, by commenting/uncommenting the corresponding lines.
